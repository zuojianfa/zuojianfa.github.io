# Author's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a seasoned engineer with extensive experience in various domains of software engineering. My expertise spans across Multi-Value DBMS kernel development, compiler engineering, system software, distributed systems, and more. Below is a brief overview of my background, main projects, and technology stack.

## Introduction

As a Multi-Value DBMS Kernel Core Engineer, I specialize in designing and developing advanced database management systems. My experience as a Compiler Engineer has honed my skills in creating efficient and optimized code. With a strong background in system software and distributed systems, I am adept at architecting robust solutions for complex problems. I am proficient in C, C++, Rust, Python, Java, C# and Linux, which allows me to tackle a wide range of technical challenges.

# Open Source Software

## CA Programming Language

CA is a programming language which has similar grammars as rust language, similar to C language in many features, compatible with C ABI, support calling C functions directly without any matching and  transformation. It uses Mark-and-Sweep style garbage collections for  it's memory management.

CA compiler uses LLVM as its backend, and uses JIT or AOT  technology in LLVM to run program directly without compile. Currently,  CA compiler is under development, it has already realized most of  grammars, but still have a lot of works to do.

For language details see the book: [CA book](https://github.com/zuojianfa/ca/blob/generic/book/ca-book.md).
